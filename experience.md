### Experience
Since I began programming in High School, I have done a number of projects.

#### MegaMiner AI
As a member of the **ACM SIG-Game** Game and AI sub-teams, I have helped organize [MegaMiner AI](siggame.io), a 24 hour event held twice a year by SIG-Game that has competitors from all over try to create the best AI for a game that we design in a few weeks.

On the teams that I have been a part of, I have helped to develop the game mechanics, and helped to balance the game, as well as design my own AI to test the game (and try to win of course).

The game server is developed mainly using Javascript, while the AIs can be created using any of the following:
- Javascript
- Java
- Python
- C++
- C#
- Lua

#### acm.mst.edu
As a member of **ACM SIG.com** I have helped develop the frontend and backend aspects of the website, [acm.mst.edu](https://acm.mst.edu).

[acm.mst.edu](https://acm.mst.edu) is developed using:
- HTML/CSS
- Python
- Django
- Sphinx
