        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>Since I began programming in high school, I have done a number of
            projects.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>MegaMiner AI</h5>
        <p>As a member of the <b>ACM SIG-Game</b> Game and AI sub-teams, I
        have helped organize <a href="https://siggame.io">MegaMiner AI</a>,
        a 24-hour event held once a semester by SIG-Game that has competitors
        from all over try to create the best AI for a game that we design over
        the course of a few weeks.</p>

        <p>On the teams that I have been a part of, I have helped to develop
        game mechanics, balance game mechanics, and design my own AI to test
        the game. I also try to make my AI the best I can just because I find
        it fun.</p>
        
        <p>The game server is developed mainly using Javascript, while the AI
        clents can be created using any of the following languages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Lua</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Chess</h5>
        <p>During the Spring 2018 semester, I have been developing my own
        chess AI using many different techniques. I have been implementing
        the AI using SIG-Game's AI framework that it uses for MegaMiner AI,
        however, instead of using simple tactics to try an implement a
        specific strategy, I have been trying to implement the Minimax search
        algorithm to play chess. Along with Minimax, I have also developed
        my own <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Bitboards">
        bitboard</a> in order to speed up my AI's search time to have a
        better chance of winning the game.</p>
        <p>My chess AI was developed entirely in C#</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Other Work Experience</h5>
        <p>I have worked in a few other locations, to find out move, email me
