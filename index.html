        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Since I began programming in high school, I have worked on a number
        of projects.</p>

        <h3>MegaMiner AI</h3>
        <p>As a member of the <b>ACM SIG-Game</b> Game and AI sub-teams, I
        have helped organize
        <a href="https://siggame.github.io">MegaMiner AI</a>,
        a 24-hour event held once a semester by SIG-Game that has competitors
        from all over try to create the best AI for a game that we design over
        the course of a few weeks.</p>

        <p>On the teams that I have been a part of, I have helped to develop
        game mechanics, balance game mechanics, and design my own AI to test
        the game. I also try to make my AI the best I can just because I find
        it fun.</p>
        
        <p>The game server is developed mainly using Javascript, while the AI
        clents can be created using any of the following languages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Lua</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>During the Spring 2018 semester, I have been developing my own
        chess AI for my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course using 
        many different techniques. I have been implementing the AI using
        SIG-Game's AI framework that it uses for MegaMiner AI, however,
        instead of using simple tactics to implement a specific strategy, I
        have been trying to implement the Minimax search algorithm to play
        chess. Along with Minimax, I have also developed my own
        <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Bitboards">
        bitboard</a> in order to speed up my AI's search time to have a better
        chance of winning the game.</p>

        <p>My chess AI client was developed entirely in C#.</p>

        <h3>Archlinux</h3>
        <p>Since 2017, I have been continually trying to teach myself all that
        I can about Linux and everything that it has to offer. The Linux
        distribution that I have been learning on is
        <a href="https://archlinux.org">Archlinux</a>, a simple distribution
        that I thought would be the best to get a good idea about Linux and
        how everything about it works. It was somewhat hard to setup, but I
        eventually figured out the basics of setting up my own desktop
        environment, and now I do most of my programming on Arch, which is
        much easier to develop on than Windows. I do still have Windows on
        my desktop computer for most things, but for developing, I prefer to
        do it on Linux.</p>
        <p>For my own reference, I made my own git repository to help myself
        to remember my setup here:
        <a href="https://github.com/trunko/linux_config">link</a>.</p>

        <h5>Other Work Experience</h5>
